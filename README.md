## TODO
- [ ] Create Default values for enum, array, set, map, etc.

## General
Run and compiled for Python 3.9.13.
Expected to run for Python 3+

## Development

### Testing
run tests with `pytest -s -vv` to see all the details.

### Installation as Consuming Developer

Simply run: `pip install fa-models`

Import in modules without the dash (e.g.): `from famodels.signal import Signal`

### Setup as Contributor
Create the virtul environment: 
```
py -m venv .venv
```
Start the Environment: 
```
./.venv/Scripts/activate
```
 (or allow VS Code to start it). Use `deactivate`to stop it.

All the required libraries must be listed in requirements.txt and installed by  
```
python -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
For Dev use 
```
python -m pip install -r .\requirements-dev.txt
```

To cleanup the environment run:
```
pip3 freeze > to-uninstall.txt
```
 and then
```
pip3 uninstall -y -r to-uninstall.txt
```

or 
```
pip3 install pip-autoremove
```

### Build Library
Prerequisite: make sure that you give your Operating System user the right to modify files in the python directory. The directory where pyhton is installed.
Use `python setup.py bdist_wheel` to create the dist, build and .eggs folder.

## Reference from a different project
In order to use your own version of the project - to maybe contribute to the library - simply clone the code from github into new directory. Then add the path of that new directory to the requirements.txt file of your project. Then change in fa-models whatever you recommend to improve. Don't forget the Open-Closed Principle: extend only (unless it requires a breaking change)


## Releasing a new version

Delete any old files in the /dist and build folder of your local environment.
Update your pip: 
```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the tools build, twine and bumpver: 
```
python -m pip install build twine bumpver
```
Upgrade the setuptools: 

```
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

Bump the version in pyproject.toml: 
```
bumpver update --patch
```
This will commit a new version to GitHub.

Build the project: 
```
python -m build
```

Check the distribution: 
```
twine check dist/*
```

Upload to test-pypi to validate: 
```
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
```

Login with username: (password should be known)

If the test-upload was successful, finally, upload to pypi production: 

```
twine upload dist/*
```

Done.

(P.S. Do not forget to update the library in your projects: `pip install --upgrade fa-models`)bumpver update --patch
